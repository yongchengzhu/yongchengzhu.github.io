          <p class="section-text">
            Recently, I've been running into a few Leetcode problems that requires
            a Heap solution. The disadvantage of using Javascript is that it has
            no built-in libraries for many useful data structures such as Heap.
            Hence today I will try to implement a Binary Heap class so that
            I can easiy copy this over to my Leetcode solution and make use of it
            easily. To keep the code short and simple, I will only implement two
            methods: \(insert()\) and \(extract()\). This will be a Min Heap.
          </p>

          <p class="section-text">
            To implement any class, we need a constructor. When a new Heap object
            is instantiated, an empty Heap should be created (as an array in this
            case).
          </p>

          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
              var MinHeap = class MinHeap {
                  constructor() {
                      this.heap = [];
                  }
              }
            </code>
          </pre>

          <p class="section-text">
            Next, let's implement the logic for \(insert()\). The idea is that,
            whenever a new element is inserted into the Heap, first it's pushed
            to the end of the Heap and then it repeatedly compares itself with
            the parent. If it's smaller than the parent, then it swaps with the
            the parent and repeats until parent node is reached.
          </p>

          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
              var MinHeap = class MinHeap {
                  constructor() {
                      this.heap = [];
                  }

                  insert(entry) {
                      this.heap.push(entry);

                      const length  = this.heap.length;
                      let   current = length - 1;
                      let   parent  = Math.floor((current - 1) / 2);

                      while (current > 0) {
                          if (this.heap[current] < this.heap[parent]) {
                              this.swap(current, parent);
                              current = parent;
                              parent  = Math.floor((current - 1) / 2);
                          } else {
                              return;
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
            </code>

          <p class="section-text">
            The \(extract()\) method needs a bit more work, but it's not too bad.
            Basically, whenever we extract an element from the Heap, first, it
            removes the root element, then the last element becomes the root element.
            Now, repeated compare the root element with it's left and right children.
            If the root element is smaller than both children then the loop ends.
            Otherwise, swap the root element with the smallest children element
            and repeat until the bottom of the Heap.

            The good thing about Binary Heap is that building a Heap from an
            array of \(N\) elements requires \(O(N)\) runtime. Hence, if we were
            to extract \(K\) elements from the heap, it would cost \(O(K \log{N})\),
            which is slightly better than regular sort.
