Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
             Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

            My first approach to this problem was to try to make as many transactions
            as possible and find the maximum profits at all intervals where the
            stock prices are increasing. Then, take the top 2 profits and add
            them together. However, this approach doesn't account the case where
            the input array is \([1,2,4,2,5,7,2,4,9,0]\). My code calculated
            the maximum profit to be \(12\) (which is wrong), and the correct
            output happened to been \(13\). The problem was that I calculate
            the profits at 3 intervals resulting in three different maximum
            profits \(3, 5, 7\), which then my code would take \(output = 5 + 7 = 12\).
            However, the correct profits should've been calculated only at 2 intervals
            which would yielded the maximum profits \(6, 7\) and the output
            would be correct in this case.

              var maxProfit = function(prices) {
                  let topTwo = new Array(2).fill(0);
                  let result = 0;
                  let profit = 0;

                  for (let l = 0, r = 1; r < prices.length; ++r) {
                      if (prices[r] > prices[r - 1]) {
                          profit = prices[r] - prices[l];
                      } else {
                          l = r;
