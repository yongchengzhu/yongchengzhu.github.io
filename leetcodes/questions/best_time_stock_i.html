Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

            By intuition, we are searching for subarrays from the input array,
            where the first element in each subarrays are the smallest elements
            in their subarrays. The maximum profit in each subarray would be
            the largest element subtracted by the first element. We just need to
            keep track of a maximum profit for all the subarrays.
          </p>

          <p class="section-text">
            I would approach this problem with a sliding window. Let the left
            pointer point to the first element in the input array, and let the
            right pointer point to the second element. If the right pointer is
            pointing to an element that's greater than the left pointer, then
            that means the left pointer is not pointing to the smallest element
            in the current subarray hence we need to make left pointer jump to
            the right pointer. If the right pointer does indeed point to an
            element that's greater than the left pointer, then calculate their
            differences and keep track of a maximum profit until the right
            pointer goes out of range.
          </p>

          <pre>
            <code class="language-javascript">
              var maxProfit = function(prices) {
                  let result = 0;

                  for (let l = 0, r = 1; r < prices.length; ++r) {
                      if (prices[l] < prices[r]) {
                          result = Math.max(result, prices[r] - prices[l]);
                      } else {
                          l = r;
                      }
                  }

                  return result;
              };
